Stream enables a coworking space community feed where members can communicate. Stream allows to:

- Share status updates in real time.
- Attach photos to posts.
- React to posts.
- Receive push notifications for new posts.

Stream integration adds a new "Stream" button and works in-app without redirecting or requiring to install another app. To enable the integration, have your API key and secret ready: https://getstream.io/dashboard
