Connect a personal or work Google Calendar to sync all bookings made on andcards. If you make a meeting room reservation on andcards, it will automatically appear in your calendar.

It may take up to 12 hours for a meeting room reservation to appear on Google Calendar due to Google's caching mechanism.
