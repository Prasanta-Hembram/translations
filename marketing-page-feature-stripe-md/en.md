Enable Stripe to instantly acquire debit or credit cards right inside the app. Turn on 'Card' payment method for:

- Meeting room booking page.
- Invoice payment page.

Stripe payments work in-app without redirecting or requiring to install another app. To enable the integration, have your API keys ready: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
