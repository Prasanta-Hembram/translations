Kisi is a cloud-based access control system that allows you to:

- Sync members and their information with Kisi access levels.
- Serve meeting room availability, allowing unlocks only by the booker.
- Manage access to all locks within the Kisi platform.
- Have 24/7 activity data to understand usage patterns.
- Remote door unlock with a smartphone.

The integration is currently in development, so the features are not final. Contact us to request early access.
